I still haven't decided on a name for this language so I'm
sticking to calling it Gold for now.

Hope I can come up with something good soon!!! Because naming
something "Gold" comes with two main downsides:

1. It's a common Google query (not a unique name).
2. Sounds a little pretentious if you ask me.
