## Data types

Data type names are the same as in Rust:

1. Integers:
	1. `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`.
2. Floats:
	1. `f32`, `f64`.
3. Text:
	1. `char`, `str`.

\* Data types for other bases to be added.

## Variables

Declaring variables in Gold is similar to doing so in C.

``` c
/* int */
i32 i = 5;
/* double */
f64 f = 3.14;
/* char */
char c = 'a';

/* Multiple variables */
i32 a, b, c, d, e;
f64 x = 1.1, y = 2.2, z = 3.3;
```

---

## Functions

Declaring functions in Gold is a bit different to other languages.
It's my belief, though, that it's clearer in this way and also
more intuitive.

``` c
(f64 x, f64 y, f64 z) to f64    /* Parameters always in parenthesis */
calc_sum
{
	return x + y + z;           /* Explicit return */
}
```

The first line indicates the parameters and the data type of the
return value. The second line, the name. And everything after the
curly braces is the code that the function executes upon call.

If we want to write a function with no return value:

``` c
(i32 i) to void
print_i32
{
	print("Your number is {i}\n");
}
```

or:

``` c
/* Please, use (void) here */
(void) to void
print_cats
{
	print("Cats\n");
}
```

To call functions, the syntax is similar to most other languages:

``` c
f64 sum = calc_sum(x, y, z);    /* Function with return value */

print_i32(i);                   /* No return value but with parameters */

print_cats();                   /* No return value and no parameters */
```

## References

Unlike most other programming languages, Gold doesn't use the
standard `&` and `*` for references and dereferences, respectively.

Instead, to reference the address of a variable:

``` c
i32 x = 7;
/* @x Read as "at x" or "the address of x" */
i32 px = @x;
```

To dereference a reference:

``` c
/* Read as "to px" or "the value at the address where px points" */
i32 y = 3 * >px;
```

## Operators

### Arithmetic operators

``` c
a + b;    /* a plus b  */
a - b;    /* a minus b */
a * b;    /* a multiplied by b */
a / b;    /* a divided by b    */
a % b;    /* the remainder of a divided by b */
```

Sadly, there will be no increment or decrement operator.

### Relational operators

``` c
a == b;    /* a is equal to b     */
a != b;    /* a is not equal to b */
a >  b;    /* a is greater than b */
a <  b;    /* a is less than b    */
a >= b;    /* a is greater than or equal to b */
a >= b;    /* a is less than or equal to b    */
```

### Logical operators

``` c
a & b; a and b;    /* a and b */
a | b; a or  b;    /* a or b  */
!a; not a;         /* not a   */
```

\* `!` and `not` can be used with parenthesis, e.g.:

``` c
if !(a <= 0 | b <= 0): print("a and b are greater than 0\n");
```

or:

``` c
/* Parenthesis after words should have a space in between */
if not (a <= 0 or b <= 0): print("a and b are greater than 0\n");
```

### Bitwise operators

``` c
a && b;    /* a AND b */
a || b;    /* a OR  b */
a ^^ b;    /* a XOR b */
a << b;    /* Shift a's bytes by b to the left  */
a >> b;    /* Shift a's bytes by b to the right */
~a;        /* Flip a's bytes */
```

### Assignment operators

``` c
a  = b;     /* Assign b to a      */
a += b;     /* Assign a + b to a  */
a -= b;     /* Assign a - b to a  */
a *= b;     /* Assign a * b to a  */
a /= b;     /* Assign a / b to a  */
a %= b;     /* Assign a % b to a  */
a &&= b;    /* Assign a && b to a */
a ||= b;    /* Assign a || b to a */
a ^^= b;    /* Assign a ^^ b to a */
a <<= b;    /* Assign a << b to a */
a >>= b;    /* Assign a >> b to a */
```

---

## Control Flow

### If statement

Starting with the if statement, the syntax is basically the same
as C's:

``` c
i32 x = 7, y = 11;

/* No parenthesis */
if x > 0 and y > 0 {
	print("{x} and {y} are greater than 0\n");
}
```

If we wish to just run one line of code after the if statement:

``` c
if x > 0 and y > 0:
	print("{x} and {y} are greater than 0\n");
```

or:

``` c
if x > 0 and y > 0: print("{x} and {y} are greater than 0\n");
```

This same syntax applies for all following control flow methods.

### Loop loop

The most basic loop. It just repeats forever until it encounters a
`break`.

``` c
i32 count = 1;
loop {
	if count > 100: break;
	print("{count}");
	count += 1;
}
```

### While loop

I have decided to combine what would have been the behavior of the
while and for loop in C into the Gold while loop. I think the best
part about the for loop in C is the ability to create a variable
to count the iterations within the scope of the loop. But there
are cases where this is not what we want so the syntax accommodates
for that. This is the same with the update instruction(s).

Below, a simple loop that prints the numbers from 1 to 10:

``` c
i32 n = 10;

while i32 i = 1 is i <= n end i += 1 {
	print("{i}\n");
}
```

if we wish to initialize the variable i outside the loop:

``` c
i32 i = 1;
while i <= n end i += 1: print("{i}\n");
```

and if we wish to also have the update part inside the loop:

``` c
i32 i = 1;
while i <= n { print("{i}\n"); i += 1; }
```

I encourage the developer not to exploit the syntax of this loop,
though I'm painfully aware that this advice will go unnoticed.
After all, it'd only be for readability reasons.

### For loop

This loop will be most useful for going through arrays and similar
data types without reading other memory. I works similarly to
Rust's `for` loop.

``` c
/* A short way to print the numbers from 1 to 100 */
for i32 i in 1 to 100: print("{i}");

/* Rust's rocket example showing a reversed range*/
for i32 i in 3 to 1: print("{i}");
print("Liftoff!!!");

i32 a = [11, 22, 33, 44, 55];    /* Array syntax is not final */

for i32 i in a: print("The value {i} is {}", a[i]);
```
