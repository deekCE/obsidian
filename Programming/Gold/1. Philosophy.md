"Gold" strives to be a programming language that is small, explicit
and consistent in its syntax, easy to read* and memory safe and
entirely procedural.

\* Tries to use common English constructions for its syntax.

All of this without compromising on compile time or runtime speed.
This doesn't mean it'll be very abstracted, in fact it will require
the developer to engage with many low-level aspects of the system.

### Hello world in Gold:

``` c
(void) to i32
main
{
	print("Hello, world!");
	
	return 0;
}
```
